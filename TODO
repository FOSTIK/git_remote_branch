- tests :-)
- offer help when branch -d fails
- better exit status behavior
- Add verification if remote delete didn't work
- New functionality:
  - Remotize an existing local branch (aliases: publish share make_remote makeremote)
    git push origin branch_name:refs/heads/branch_name
    git fetch origin
    git config branch.branch_name.remote origin
    git config branch.branch_name.merge refs/heads/branch_name
    
- add support for different remote name (--remote-name)
- avoid deleting local branches when tracking with the help of git-config ?

- drop assumption that master can be treated differently than other branches (e.g. considered as a safe checkout)
- reliance on current_branch
  - is it even necessary to be on a branch per se? I think not...
  - survive checkouts with wrong case 
    e.g.: branch "Bob" checked out branch 'bob'. git branch -l won't correctly flag branch Bob as current.
