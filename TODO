- Put in evidence the tutorial part of each grb action
- tests :-)
- re-architect the code a bit?
- better exit status behavior
- Add verification if remote delete didn't work
- Remotizing an existing local branch
  git push origin branch_name:refs/heads/branch_name
  git fetch origin
  (find a local branch other than the branch to remotize)
  git checkout master
  git branch --track -f branch_name origin/branch_name
  (yay! we don't have to delete the local one...)
- make into a gem?
  - that installs a grb command in the path?
