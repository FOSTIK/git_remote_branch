- Put in evidence the tutorial part of each grb action
  - colorize the git commands
  - Add 'explain' / 'show' command
- --reveal-secrets command. Instead of using grb, one can just see what the list of commands are for accomplishing a given task.
- tests :-)
- re-architect the code a bit?
- better exit status behavior
- Add verification if remote delete didn't work
- New functionality:
  - Remotize an existing local branch (aliases: publish share make_remote makeremote)
    git push origin branch_name:refs/heads/branch_name
    git fetch origin
    (find a local branch other than the branch to remotize)
    git checkout master
    git branch --track -f branch_name origin/branch_name
    (yay! we don't have to delete the local one...)
- add support for different remote name (--remote-name)
- avoid deleting local branches when tracking with the help of git-config ?
