==== Why git_remote_branch? ====

The basic idea for git_remote_branch is to trivialize the interaction with 
remote branches in simple situations. 

For now git_remote_branch assumes that the local and remote branches have the 
same name. Multiple origins are supported.

Another goal of git_remote_branch is to help teach the real underlying git 
commands. Each operation done on your behalf is displayed at the console.



==== Installation ====

sudo gem install webmat-git_remote_branch --source=http://gems.github.com

Note: don't add gems.github.com as a permanent source for your gems. Check out
http://gems.github.com for more information on the matter. If you've included 
it already and find yourself in trouble, check out 
http://chalain.livejournal.com/71260.html.



==== Usage ====

Notes: 
- parts between brackets are optional
- When 'origin_server' is not specified, the name 'origin' is assumed.

Available commands (with aliases):

== Help ==

$ grb [-h]    #=> Displays help

== create (alias: new) ==
Create a new local branch as well as a corresponding remote branch from the
branch you are currently on.
Automatically track the new remote branch (useful for pulling and merging).
Switch to the new branch.

$ grb create branch_name [origin_server]


== delete (aliases: destroy, kill) ==
Delete the remote branch then delete the local branch.
The local branch is not deleted if there are pending changes.

$ grb delete branch_name [origin_server]


== track (aliases: follow grab) ==
Track an existing remote branch locally.


$ grb track branch_name [origin_server]



==== History ====

This script was originally created by Carl Mercier and made public on his blog 
here:

No nonsense GIT, part 1: git-remote-branch
http://blog.carlmercier.com/2008/01/25/no-nonsense-git-part-1-git-remote-branch/


I'm using it as a starting point to make it even easier to interact with remote
repositories.
